#### Introduction
Atomic design is a design system that breaks elements on the web or mobile application into smaller elements. Atomic design was introduced by [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/), a web designer and writer from Pittsburgh, United States. With the atomic approach, the components in the application are made into smaller parts that can be more reusable.

#### Atomic Structure
